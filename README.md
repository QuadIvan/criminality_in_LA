# Criminality in LA: A Comparison Between 2023 and 2024

This project analyzes crime trends in Los Angeles using data from the official open data portal of the City of LA. With over one million records available, the study focuses on comparing criminal activity between 2023 and 2024. It identifies the most dangerous areas, crime types with the highest increase or decrease, and patterns based on geography, time of day, and day of the week.

Using **SQL**, **Python**, and **Power BI**, the goal is to extract actionable insights that could support public safety strategies — while demonstrating a complete data analysis workflow from raw data to interactive visual storytelling.

## Project Overview
[To be updated after initial exploration]

## Analytical Questions
- Has criminal activity increased in Los Angeles from 2023 to 2024?
- Which types of crimes have become more or less frequent?
- What are the most dangerous areas based on reported incidents?
- Are there specific days of the week or hours with higher crime rates?
- How do crime patterns vary across police reporting districts?

##  Tech Stack
- **SQL (PostgreSQL):** Filtering, aggregation, and data exploration on large datasets  
- **Python (pandas, matplotlib, seaborn):** Data cleaning, feature engineering, and EDA  
- **Power BI:** Interactive dashboards, geospatial and temporal visualizations
