# Criminality in LA: A Comparison Between 2023 and 2024

This project analyzes crime trends in Los Angeles using data from the official open data portal of the City of LA. With over one million records available, the study focuses on comparing criminal activity between 2023 and 2024. It identifies the most dangerous areas, crime types with the highest increase or decrease, and patterns based on geography, time of day, and day of the week.

Using **SQL**, **Python**, and **Power BI**, the goal is to extract actionable insights that could support public safety strategies — while demonstrating a complete data analysis workflow from raw data to interactive visual storytelling.
